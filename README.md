# About me

I'm a Computer Engineering student passionate about software development and artificial intelligence. Welcome to my GitHub profile, where I share the projects I’m working on as I continue to develop my skills.  

🛠️ Skills  

- Languages: JavaScript, NodeJS, Python, C, MySQL, Assembly  
- Web Development: React, HTML, CSS  
- Areas of Interest: Software Development, Artificial Intelligence (AI)  

🌱 Current Focus  
Right now, I'm working on projects related to front-end and back-end development, but my long-term goal is to specialize in Artificial Intelligence. I'll be uploading various applications that reflect my growth and learning in both of these fields.

🚀 Projects  
Expenses Tracker App (Coming soon): A simple yet functional app that helps users track their daily expenses. This project will be available on the Play Store.

💡 Why I Code  
I love building applications that I can use in my daily life. Even if similar tools already exist, my goal is to create my own versions to truly understand how they work under the hood.
